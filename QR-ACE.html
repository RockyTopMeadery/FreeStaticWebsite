This is a time-honered favorite recipe here at RTM.<br><br>

We take the finest buckwheat honey, the richest grade a amber maple syrup, and produce this mead for your enjoyment. Well, ours too... because there's usually a little bit left over.
<br><BR>
There's a very faint hint of citrus in there somewhere.<br><br>

Once the fermenting is done, this mead sits for 3 months in bourbon oak barrels, getting ready to go home with you.<br><br>

We suggest serving this beauty ever so slightly chilled in a highball or glencairn glass, like what you might drink bourbon from... but this mead is a whole lot smoother than whiskey.
